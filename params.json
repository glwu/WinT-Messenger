Install the Qt SDK from [http://qt-project.org/downloads](http://qt-project.org/downloads).\r\n2. [Download](https://github.com/WinT-3794/WinT-Messenger/archive/master.zip) the source code and extract it with your favorite ZIP utility.\r\n3. Open the wint-im.pro file with Qt Creator.\r\n4. Configure the project by selecting Windows as your target system.\r\n5. Select the \"release\" build option.\r\n5. Build and run WinT Messenger by pressing CTRL + R.\r\n\r\n### Mac OS X\r\n\r\n1. Download Xcode from the App Store.\r\n2. Open Xcode and accept the license agreement.\r\n3. After you accept the license agreement, you can safely quit Xcode (CMD + Q).\r\n4. Install the Qt SDK from [http://qt-project.org/downloads](http://qt-project.org/downloads).\r\n5. [Download](https://github.com/WinT-3794/WinT-Messenger/archive/master.zip) the source code and extract it with your favorite ZIP utility.\r\n6. Open the wint-im.pro file with Qt Creator.\r\n7. Configure the project by selecting Mac OS X as your target system.\r\n8. Select the \"release\" build option.\r\n9. Build and run WinT Messenger by pressing CMD + R.\r\n10. To install, navigate to the directory where you extracted the source code and locate a folder similar to \"build-wint-im*/src/app\" and copy the WinT Messenger.app to your Applications folder.\r\n\r\n### Linux\r\n\r\n#### Method 1 (Recommended)\r\n\r\n1. Install the Qt SDK from [http://qt-project.org/downloads](http://qt-project.org/downloads).\r\n2.

Configure the project by selecting Windows as your target system.\r\n5. Select the \"release\" build option.\r\n5. Build and run WinT Messenger by pressing CTRL + R.\r\n6. Navigate to the build directory with your preferred terminal emulator.\r\n7. Run \"sudo make install\" (without the quotes) to configure and install the application.\r\n\r\n#### Method 2 (Ubuntu-based distros only)\r\n\r\n1. [Download](https://github.com/WinT-3794/WinT-Messenger/archive/master.zip) the source code.\r\n\r\n2. Run the following commands to install the required packages for compiling\r\n\r\n        sudo add-apt-repository --yes ppa:ubuntu-sdk-team/ppa\r\n        sudo add-apt-repository --yes ppa:canonical-qt5-edgers/qt5-beta2\r\n        sudo apt-get update\r\n        sudo apt-get install build-essential qt5-qmake openssl-devel libssl-dev libpulse-dev qtbase5-dev qtdeclarative\r\n        \r\n\t+ Note that your distribution may require more packages to be installed.\r\n\r\n3. Then, go to your downloads folder and unzip the current commit.\r\n\r\n        cd ~/Downloads\r\n        unzip WinT-Messenger-master.zip -d WinT-Messenger-master\r\n        cd WinT-Messenger-master\r\n\t\r\n4.
