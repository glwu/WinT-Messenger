The application is written in QML/C++ and can be used with the most popular desktop and mobile operating systems.\r\n\r\nYou can see how the whole app works here, or even write code to make it better!\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n1.

We'll review it, and push your changes to the site!\r\n\r\n## Developer's notes\r\n\r\n### Doxygen documentation\r\n\r\nYou can find the Doxygen documentation for version 1.2.1 [here](http://wint-im.sf.net/dev-doc/html/index.html). Updated documentation for 1.3.0 will be uploaded soon.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nThis project is a subdirs project, so you can take the code from an individual module, such as the LAN Chat module (qchat) and easily implement it in your program. Each chat module is completely standalone has a main.cpp file that shows you how to implemnt a simple chat program in a command line interface.\r\n\r\nFor the moment, we have implemented the following modules:\r\n\r\n+ LAN Chat with file sharing support (src/modules/qchat)\r\n+ XMPP Chat based on QXMPP libraries (src/modules/xmpp)\r\n\r\nYou will find examples for each module that will show you how to implement and manage each module. You may use them as a base for your next chat application or to create alternative interfaces for WinT Messenger!\r\n\r\n## Setup/Compiling\r\n\r\n### Windows\r\n\r\n1. Install the Qt SDK from [http://qt-project.org/downloads](http://qt-project.org/downloads).\r\n2. [Download](https://github.com/WinT-3794/WinT-Messenger/archive/master.zip) the source code and extract it with your favorite ZIP utility.\r\n3. Open the wint-im.pro file with Qt Creator.\r\n4. Configure the project by selecting Windows as your target system.\r\n5. Select the \"release\" build option.\r\n5. Build and run WinT Messenger by pressing CTRL + R.\r\n\r\n**Notes:** \r\n\r\n+ In order to compile the application, you will need to install OpenSSL in \"C:\\OpenSSL-Win32\\\". You can get the installer [here](http://slproweb.com/download/Win32OpenSSL-1_0_1h.exe).\r\n+ If you want to install the software, you will need to deploy it with the \"windeployqt\" tool. I will upload instructions regarding deployment soon.\r\n\r\n### Mac OS X\r\n\r\n1. Download Xcode from the App Store.\r\n2. Open Xcode and accept the license agreement.\r\n3. After you accept the license agreement, you can safely quit Xcode (CMD + Q).\r\n4. Install the Qt SDK from [http://qt-project.org/downloads](http://qt-project.org/downloads).\r\n5. [Download](https://github.com/WinT-3794/WinT-Messenger/archive/master.zip) the source code and extract it with your favorite ZIP utility.\r\n6. Open the wint-im.pro file with Qt Creator.\r\n7. Configure the project by selecting Mac OS X as your target system.\r\n8. Select the \"release\" build option.\r\n9. Build and run WinT Messenger by pressing CMD + R.\r\n10. To install, navigate to the directory where you extracted the source code and locate a folder similar to \"build-wint-im-Desktop_Qt_5_3_clang_64bit-Release\" and copy the WinT Messenger.app to your Applications folder.\r\n\r\n### Ubuntu-based distros\r\n\r\n1. [Download](https://github.com/WinT-3794/WinT-Messenger/archive/master.zip) the source code.\r\n\r\n2. Run the following commands to install the required packages for compiling\r\n\r\n        sudo add-apt-repository --yes ppa:ubuntu-sdk-team/ppa\r\n        sudo add-apt-repository --yes ppa:canonical-qt5-edgers/qt5-beta2\r\n        sudo apt-get update -qq\r\n        sudo apt-get install -qq qt5-qmake openssl-devel libssl-dev libpulse-dev qtbase5-dev qtdeclarative$\r\n\r\n3. Then, go to your downloads folder and unzip the current commit.\r\n\r\n        cd ~/Downloads\r\n        unzip WinT-Messenger-master.zip -d Wint-Messenger-master\r\n        cd wint-messenger-master\r\n\t\r\n4. Make a directory to build the software\r\n    \r\n    \tmkdir build\r\n    \tcd build\r\n    \r\n5. Compile the application\r\n\r\n        qmake -qt=qt5 ../wint-im.pro\r\n        make\r\n    \r\n6. Run the application\r\n\t\r\n        make clean\r\n        cd src\r\n        ./wint-messenger\r\n\t\r\n7. To install WinT Messenger, run the following:\r\n\r\n        sudo cp wint-messenger /usr/bin/wint-messenger\r\n\t\r\n8. Create the application launchers for your application menu:\r\n\r\n        cd ../../sys/linux\r\n        sudo cp wint-messenger.svg /usr/share/pixmaps/wint-messenger.svg\r\n        sudo cp wint-messenger.desktop /usr/share/applications/wint-messenger.desktop\r\n\t\t\r\n**Note:** We will configure the project to create an installation script for the next commit during the following week.\r\n\t\r\nThat's all! To run WinT Messenger, you can type \"wint-messenger\" (without quotes) in Terminal. You can also run WinT Messenger from your application menu (Gnome) or Dash (Unity).\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nWinT Messenger is released with the GNU 3.0 license, you can read a copy \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
