This branch only hosts the file “latest.txt”, which is used by WinT Messenger’s autoupdater system.

The “current.txt” file is kept for compatibility purposes for WinT Messenger 1.2.0, which has a slightly more primitive auto-updater system. 

The reason behind uploading the updater files here is that QNetworkAccessManager could not connect to the subdomain at SourceForge because it experienced some SSL issues.
